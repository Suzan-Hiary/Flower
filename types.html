    Part of the joy of gardening is learning about new plants and adding them to your garden. And there's always space for one more plant! To keep your garden looking amazing throughout the year, make sure to mix it up: Plant annuals for quick pops of color and perennials, which come back year after year, as well as spring-flowering bulbs, evergreens and flowering shrubs. There are even plants that bloom in winter before the snow has melted to provide color during the darkest days of the year! Variety in your plantings not only provides habitat and food for pollinators such as bees, hummingbirds and butterflies, but you'll also enjoy more color for a longer period of time.

Before purchasing a plant, make sure to read the plant tag or description. When you're planting perennials or shrubs, choose those that will survive winters in your USDA Hardiness zone (find yours here). And pay attention to how much sun or shade a plant needs. Sun lovers need sun and won't bloom in shade; shade lovers will sizzle in the afternoon sun.

Whether you're just daydreaming of spring or are planning to order all your spring flowers and plants soon, read on for the best flowers for any garden, big or small, country or formal.</p>
